# Everything is fine Kata

Every Android applications can or may grow big during the years, the developers involved may join or
leave the team, the development rules can evolve. Each developer joins with his/hers style,
his/her habit, and with his/her experience level, thus every features may be developed differently.

This Kata has been made for you to work on the things that can happen on big applications if
we stop protecting its source code from features evolution. **Everything is fine Kata** offers you
some samples of what I've met on several applications during the last few years, I hope you'll find
every mistakes I've willingly (or not) made.
