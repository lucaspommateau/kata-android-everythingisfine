# Where do I start as an Expert?

I've made (a lot of) mistakes in most of the Kotlin or XML files.
As you are an expert Android developer, I won't give you any hints, you should probably:

1. identify one mistake
2. **explain it** to a colleague/friend
3. **drive him/her** so he/she could fix the mistake
4. have fun!
5. jump to the next mistake
