# Where do I start as an Intermediate?

As an intermediate Android developer you might be able to find the mistakes by yourself, here are
some hints to locate them:

- Some packages are mis-organized, you should re-organize (tip: look at **Common Closure Principle**)
- There are several naming inconsistency between 2 classes, between identifiers, and so on
- I've made a mistake about layers isolation that produces a lot of issues
- The navigation have multiple troubles, can you find them?
- You also may find some duplicate code or duplicate structures, find a way to avoid them and explain your choices
- Did you notice a glitch when you touch the pokeball in the list of Home screen?
- And to finish, there are more mistakes, search them, fix them, and have fun!
